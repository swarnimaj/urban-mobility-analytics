# Sprint 9: Amenity Proximity Score Development - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

Sprint 9 focused on developing a comprehensive amenity proximity scoring system to evaluate how accessible essential amenities are to each neighborhood. This sprint built upon the existing mobility analysis framework to create a multi-dimensional assessment of amenity access, considering distance, amenity type importance, and accessibility features.

## üéØ Sprint Objectives

The primary goal was to create a robust scoring system that evaluates:
1. **Amenity Proximity**: Distance-based access to essential amenities
2. **Amenity Type Importance**: Weighted scoring based on amenity criticality
3. **Accessibility Features**: Penalty system for inaccessible amenities
4. **Comprehensive Scoring**: Combined assessment for urban planning insights

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Scoring Methodology

#### 1. Distance Calculation (Euclidean Method)
**Purpose**: Calculate distances from neighborhood centroids to all amenities.

**Calculation Process**:
1. **CRS Conversion**: Convert both datasets to projected CRS (EPSG:3857) for accurate distance calculations
2. **Centroid Extraction**: Extract neighborhood centroids and amenity points
3. **Distance Matrix**: Calculate Euclidean distances using scipy.spatial.distance.cdist
4. **Filtering**: Only include amenities within max_distance (default 2000m)

**Key Metrics**:
- `distance_m`: Distance from neighborhood to amenity in meters
- `neighborhood_id`: Identifier for the neighborhood
- `amenity_id`: Identifier for the amenity

#### 2. Amenity Type Weighting (25% weight)
**Purpose**: Apply importance weights based on amenity type criticality.

**Weight System**:
```python
weights = {
    'hospital': 1.0,           # Critical healthcare
    'clinic': 0.9,             # Healthcare access
    'doctors': 0.9,            # Healthcare access
    'pharmacy': 0.8,           # Healthcare access
    'school': 0.9,             # Education
    'library': 0.7,            # Education/culture
    'community_centre': 0.6,   # Community services
    'bank': 0.6,               # Financial services
    'post_office': 0.5,        # Government services
    'restaurant': 0.4,         # Food services
    'cafe': 0.3,               # Food services
    'bus_station': 0.7,        # Transportation
    'default': 0.5             # Default weight for unknown types
}
```

**Calculation**:
```python
distance_score = (1.0 / (distance_m + 1)) * amenity_weight
```

#### 3. Accessibility Penalty System (20% weight)
**Purpose**: Apply penalties for inaccessible amenities to promote inclusive design.

**Penalty Factors**:
```python
penalty_factors = {
    'not_accessible': 0.5,        # 50% penalty
    'partially_accessible': 0.25, # 25% penalty
    'fully_accessible': 0.0,      # No penalty
    'unknown': 0.15               # 15% penalty (conservative)
}
```

**Calculation**:
```python
final_score = weighted_score * (1.0 - accessibility_penalty)
```

#### 4. Score Normalization (15% weight)
**Purpose**: Normalize scores to 0-100 range for consistent interpretation.

**Methods**:
- **Min-Max Normalization**: `(score - min) / (max - min) * 100`
- **Z-Score Normalization**: `50 + (z_score * 20)` with clipping to 0-100

### Data Processing Pipeline

#### Input Data Requirements
1. **Neighborhoods**: GeoDataFrame with census tract boundaries
2. **Amenities**: GeoDataFrame with amenity locations and types
3. **Accessibility Data**: Wheelchair and accessibility category information

#### Data Validation
- **Geometry Validation**: Ensures valid geometries and proper CRS
- **Data Completeness**: Checks for required columns and non-null values
- **Quality Assessment**: Calculates data quality scores
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing data

#### Output Structure
```python
{
    'geoid': str,                    # Census tract identifier
    'name': str,                     # Neighborhood name
    'geometry': geometry,            # Census tract polygon
    'amenity_access_score': float,   # Final normalized score (0-100)
    'amenity_density': float,        # Amenity density per neighborhood
    'amenity_diversity': float,      # Number of unique amenity types
    'accessibility_score': float,    # Average accessibility score
    'raw_amenity_score': float,      # Raw score before normalization
    'avg_amenity_score': float,      # Average score per amenity
    'amenity_count': int,            # Total number of amenities
    'avg_distance': float            # Average distance to amenities
}
```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### 1. Missing Data Handling
- **Empty Amenities**: Returns zero scores with appropriate warnings
- **Missing Accessibility Data**: Handles gracefully with default values
- **Invalid Geometries**: Filters out problematic features
- **CRS Mismatches**: Automatic conversion to projected CRS

#### 2. Data Quality Issues
