# Data Sources Documentation

This document describes the data sources used in the Urban Mobility Analytics project, their schemas, and how to access them.

## Overview

The project integrates data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive mobility equity analysis:

1. **Census API**: Demographic and commuting data
2. **GTFS Feeds**: Public transportation schedules and stops
3. **OpenStreetMap**: Infrastructure and amenity data
4. **Local Government Data**: Additional context and validation

GTFS is a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. Transit agencies publish GTFS feeds that include information about routes, stops, schedules, and accessibility features.

### Access Method
- **Manual download** from transit agency websites
- **Registration required** for some agencies
- **Usage terms** may apply
- **Update frequency**: Varies by agency (daily to monthly)

   - 0 or empty = No information
   - 1 = Some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair
   - 2 = Wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop

2. **trips.txt**: The `wheelchair_accessible` field indicates if a trip is accessible:
   - 0 or empty = No information
   - 1 = Vehicle can accommodate at least one rider in a wheelchair
   - 2 = Vehicle cannot accommodate riders in wheelchairs

## Local Government Data

### Description
Additional data sources from local government agencies provide context and validation for the analysis.

### Current Sources

| Source | Data Type | Coverage | Status |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| King County GIS | Administrative boundaries | King County, WA | âœ… Active |
| Seattle Open Data | Additional transit data | Seattle, WA | ðŸ”„ Planned |
| Washington State DOT | Highway data | Washington State | ðŸ”„ Planned |

### Sample Usage

from src.data_acquisition.data_sources import LocalDataSource

# Initialize local data source
local = LocalDataSource()

# Get administrative boundaries
boundaries = local.get_administrative_boundaries("King County")
```

## Data Integration

### Spatial Joins
All data sources are integrated using spatial relationships:

1. **Census Tracts** serve as the base geographic unit
2. **Transit Stops** are joined using spatial containment
3. **OSM Features** are joined using spatial intersection
4. **Local Data** provides additional context and validation

### Coordinate Reference System
All spatial data is standardized to **EPSG:4326** (WGS84) for consistency.

### Data Quality
Each data source includes quality metrics:
- **Completeness**: Percentage of non-null values
- **Validity**: Data type and range validation
- **Consistency**: Cross-field validation
- **Spatial quality**: Geometry validation

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Automated Workflow
1. **Data Download**: Automated fetching from all sources
2. **Data Cleaning**: Standardization and validation
3. **Spatial Processing**: Coordinate system alignment and spatial joins
4. **Quality Assessment**: Automated quality checks
5. **Integration**: Combined mobility index calculation
6. **Output**: GeoParquet files with metadata and lineage tracking

### File Naming Convention
All processed files follow the pattern: `{dataset_type}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}.geoparquet`

### Latest File Detection
The system automatically detects and loads the most recent file for each dataset type.

## Usage Examples

### Complete Pipeline
```python
from src.utils.pipeline_runner import PipelineRunner

# Run complete pipeline for Seattle
PipelineRunner.run_pipeline("Seattle")
```

### Individual Data Sources
```python
# Load latest data
from src.visualization.app import load_transit_data, load_mobility_data

transit_data = load_transit_data()
mobility_data = load_mobility_data()

# Analyze accessibility
accessible_stops = transit_data[transit_data['wheelchair_accessible'] == 'yes']
print(f"Accessibility rate: {len(accessible_stops)/len(transit_data)*100:.1f}%")
```

## Data Updates

### Update Frequency
- **Census Data**: Annual (ACS 5-year estimates)
- **GTFS Data**: Daily to monthly (varies by agency)
- **OSM Data**: Continuous (real-time updates)
- **Local Data**: Varies by source

### Version Control
All data versions are tracked with timestamps and metadata for reproducibility.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Census API Limits**: Use API key for higher limits
2. **GTFS Download Failures**: Check agency website for updates
3. **OSM Rate Limiting**: Implement delays between requests
4. **Spatial Join Errors**: Verify coordinate reference systems

### Support
For data source issues, check:
- Agency websites for GTFS updates
- Census API documentation for variable changes
- OSM documentation for tag updates
