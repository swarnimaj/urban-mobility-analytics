# Sprint 8: Sidewalk & Ramp Score Development - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

Sprint 8 focused on developing a comprehensive sidewalk and ramp accessibility scoring system to evaluate pedestrian infrastructure quality across neighborhoods. This sprint built upon the existing transit scoring framework to create a multi-dimensional assessment of sidewalk coverage, curb ramp availability, pedestrian islands, and overall accessibility.

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

The primary goal was to create a robust scoring system that evaluates:
1. **Sidewalk Coverage**: Density and completeness of pedestrian infrastructure
2. **Curb Ramp Availability**: Accessibility features at street crossings
3. **Pedestrian Islands**: Safety features for street crossings
4. **Overall Accessibility**: Combined scoring for comprehensive assessment

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Technical Issues Encountered and Resolved

#### 1. Data Integration Pipeline Issues
**Issue**: Sidewalk quality scores were not being calculated because the data integration pipeline hadn't been run.
- **Root Cause**: The `DataCleaner.integrate_data()` method requires a city name parameter, not direct data
- **Resolution**: Updated the pipeline runner to properly execute the full data integration process
- **Impact**: Enabled calculation of actual sidewalk quality scores for 495 neighborhoods

#### 2. IndexError in DataFrame Operations
**Issue**: `IndexError: iloc cannot enlarge its target object` during `calculate_sidewalk_coverage` and `calculate_comprehensive_sidewalk_score` tests.
- **Root Cause**: New columns were being assigned using `iloc` without ensuring they existed in the DataFrame first
- **Resolution**: Added explicit column existence checks: `if key not in result.columns: result[key] = 0.0` before assignment
- **Files Affected**: `src/analysis/sidewalk_score.py` in `_calculate_sidewalk_coverage`, `_identify_missing_curb_ramps`, and `_calculate_pedestrian_islands` methods

#### 3. NaN Handling in Data Validation
**Issue**: `AssertionError: np.float64(nan) != 0` in `test_validate_sidewalk_data_empty` test.
- **Root Cause**: `np.mean()` function returning `NaN` when an empty list of scores was passed
- **Resolution**: Added conditional check: `if valid_scores: overall_score = np.mean(valid_scores) else: overall_score = 0`
- **Files Affected**: `src/analysis/sidewalk_score.py` in `validate_sidewalk_data` method

#### 4. Visualization Issues
**Issue**: Multiple visualization problems reported by user:
- Incorrect graph colors (all purple, no yellow)
- Large graph sizes that didn't fit on dashboard
- Inconsistent data length calculations
- Confusing legend with duplicate "Sidewalks" entries

**Resolution Steps**:
- **Color Scale**: Implemented quantile-based scaling for better visualization of low scores
- **Colormap**: Changed from 'viridis' to 'plasma' for better representation of low values
- **Figure Size**: Reduced `figsize` and `dpi` parameters across all visualization functions
- **Length Calculation**: Fixed by reprojecting sidewalk data to `EPSG:3857` before calculating length
- **Legend**: Removed confusing legend entries and added clear explanations

#### 5. Data Distribution Misunderstanding
**Issue**: User confusion about why most neighborhoods showed low scores (purple) with no high scores (yellow).
- **Root Cause**: Real data showed bimodal distribution with most neighborhoods having poor sidewalk infrastructure
- **Resolution**: 
  - Updated explanations to clarify that low scores reflect real infrastructure gaps
  - Added context about Seattle's actual sidewalk infrastructure challenges
  - Improved visualization to better show variation in low scores
- **Data Reality**: 325 neighborhoods (66%) have scores ≤50, 170 neighborhoods (34%) have scores >50

#### 6. Axis Label Clarity
**Issue**: Geographic maps showing "Latitude" and "Longitude" labels without numerical values.
- **Root Cause**: Matplotlib's default behavior for geographic plots
- **Resolution**: 
  - Added descriptive labels: "Latitude (South to North)" and "Longitude (West to East)"
  - Enabled axis ticks with `ax.tick_params()` for better geographic reference
  - Added coordinate values for better spatial context

#### 7. Data Type Warnings
**Issue**: `FutureWarning: Setting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated` during data processing.
- **Root Cause**: Assigning float values to int64 columns in pandas
- **Resolution**: Added explicit type conversion in data processing pipeline
- **Files Affected**: `src/analysis/sidewalk_score.py` in scoring calculations

### Scoring Methodology

#### 1. Sidewalk Coverage Score (40% weight)
**Purpose**: Evaluates the density and completeness of pedestrian infrastructure.

**Calculation Process**:
1. **Spatial Join**: Identifies sidewalks within each neighborhood boundary
2. **Area Calculation**: Calculates total sidewalk area using projected CRS (EPSG:3857)
3. **Coverage Percentage**: `(sidewalk_area / neighborhood_area) * 100`
4. **Density Metrics**: Sidewalk length per square kilometer
5. **Fallback Method**: When street network unavailable, uses density-based approach

**Key Metrics**:
- `sidewalk_coverage_pct`: Percentage of neighborhood covered by sidewalks
- `sidewalk_length_km`: Total sidewalk length in kilometers
- `sidewalk_density_km_sqkm`: Sidewalk density per square kilometer

#### 2. Curb Ramp Score (25% weight)
**Purpose**: Assesses availability of accessibility features at street crossings.

**Calculation Process**:
1. **Crossing Identification**: Extracts crossings from sidewalk data using OSM tags
2. **Ramp Detection**: Identifies curb ramps using `kerb=*` and `incline` tags
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Finds crossings within neighborhood boundaries
4. **Coverage Calculation**: `(crossings_with_ramps / total_crossings) * 100`

**Key Metrics**:
- `total_crossings`: Number of pedestrian crossings in neighborhood
- `crossings_with_ramps`: Number of crossings with curb ramps
- `ramp_coverage_pct`: Percentage of crossings with ramps

#### 3. Pedestrian Island Score (15% weight)
**Purpose**: Evaluates presence of safety features for street crossings.

**Calculation Process**:
1. **Island Detection**: Identifies pedestrian refuge islands using OSM tags
2. **Crossing Association**: Links islands to nearby crossings
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Calculates percentage of crossings with islands

**Key Metrics**:
- `crossings_with_islands`: Number of crossings with refuge islands
- `island_coverage_pct`: Percentage of crossings with islands

#### 4. Accessibility Score (20% weight)
**Purpose**: Combined accessibility assessment.

**Calculation**:
```python
accessibility_score = (
    0.4 * coverage_score +
    0.25 * ramp_score +
    0.15 * island_score +
    0.2 * accessibility_features_score
)
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

```

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### Development Challenges
1. **Data Pipeline Dependencies**: The scoring system required full data integration pipeline execution, not just individual component testing
2. **Real Data Distribution**: Actual urban data often shows skewed distributions that require specialized visualization approaches
3. **User Experience**: Technical accuracy must be balanced with user understanding and clear explanations
4. **Geographic Visualization**: Maps require careful consideration of coordinate systems, scaling, and user interpretation

### Key Insights
1. **Infrastructure Reality**: Real urban data reveals significant infrastructure gaps that are valuable for planning
2. **Visualization Design**: Low-value data requires specialized color scaling and explanation strategies
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive edge case testing is crucial for production systems
4. **User Communication**: Technical results need clear context and explanation for non-technical users

### Best Practices Established
1. **Quantile-based Scaling**: For skewed data distributions in visualizations
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Edge cases and error conditions must be thoroughly tested
3. **Clear Documentation**: Technical issues and resolutions should be documented for future reference
4. **User-Centric Design**: Visualizations should prioritize user understanding over technical complexity
